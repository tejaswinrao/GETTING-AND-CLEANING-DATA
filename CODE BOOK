This file describes the variables of 'average_data' dataset, obtained after performing run_analysis.R
'average_data' contains 180 observations of 50 variables.

The data are based on the data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset - Version 1.0"
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed.

For each record it is provided:

[1] "Activity"

WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
