# GETTING-AND-CLEANING-DATA
PEERED ASSIGNMENT
OUTPUT:-
The tidy data set a set of variables for each activity and each subject. 10299 instances are split into 180 groups (30 subjects and 6 activities) and 66 mean and standard deviation features are averaged for each group. The resulting data table has 180 rows and 69 columns – 33 Mean variables + 33 Standard deviation variables + 1 Subject( 1 of of the 30 test subjects) + ActivityName + ActivityNum . The tidy data set’s first row is the header containing the names for each column.
VARIABLES:-
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#  t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.
# Body = related to body movement.
# Gravity = acceleration of gravity
# Acc = accelerometer measurement
# Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
# Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
# Mag = magnitude of movement
# mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements. The units given are g’s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.
